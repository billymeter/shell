NAME
        myshell - a simple shell that supports backgrounding of processes

SYNOPSIS
        myshell
        myshell [batch file]

DESCRIPTION
        myshell is a simple shell. It supports a number of built in commands as
        well as the ability to background processes. It can also process batch 
        scripts when the filename to the batch file is passed to myshell as an
        argument.

    Argument list processing
        The first argument to the shell is the filename of a batch file. All 
        other arguments are ignored. This batch file is just a plain text 
        file that has one command per line for the shell to process.

    Commands
        myshell supports a number of built in commands:
            cd <directory> - Changes the current working directory to 
            <directory>. If <directory> is not present then the current 
            working directory is printed to the screen.

            clr - Clears the screen.

            dir <directory> - Lists the contents of <directory>. If 
            <directory> is not specified then the current directory is used.

            echo <comment> - Displays <comment> to the screen followed by a 
            newline.

            help - Displays the user manual for myshell.

            pause - Pauses operation of the shell until 'Enter' is pressed.

            quit - Quits the shell.

        All other commands are assumed to be external programs and will 
        attempt to execute them.

    Features
        myshell supports the ability to process batch files. The batch files 
        are assumed to be plain text with one command per line. myshell will
        terminate when the end of the file is reached.
        myshell also supports the ability to background external processes. 
        This can be accomplished by adding an ampersand, '&', to the end of 
        a non-built in command. Backgrounding a process will bring you to
        the shell prompt immediately while the process runs in the background.
